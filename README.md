# Toilet Simulation

This project is a toilet simulation created as part of a university course requirement.

### Description
The Toilet Simulation is a software application that simulates the usage of toilets in a specific setting. It aims to provide insights into toilet occupancy, usage patterns, and wait times. The simulation takes into account various factors such as the number of available toilets, the arrival rate of users, and the duration of each visit. By running the simulation, users can analyze and optimize toilet facilities in different scenarios to improve efficiency and user satisfaction.
